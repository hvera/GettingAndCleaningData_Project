CodeBook for Getting and Cleaning Data - Cousera Course Project

The code for the project is in the file run_analysis.R

This program downloads the data from 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Full description of the data set:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data is downloaded to the ./data directory, which is created if it doesn't exist.

The data is only downloaded if it doesn't already exist in the data directory.

Application variables:
dataURL - The URL of the source data (described above)
dataDir - The ./data directory for the working data files
extractDir - The directory name where the data is actually unzipped: "UCI HAR Dataset"
testDataDir - Subdirectory of the source data that contains test data
trainDataDir - Subdirectory of the source data that contains training data

Processing Steps:

- Data is read from the source files into the following variables
  subject_test, subject_train, test_y, test_x

- Features and activity labels are read into
  features, activity_labels

- Subject data (train and test) is merged into `subject` variable and labeled with `Subject`

- The test_x and train_x tables are tagged with the features names from the features table

- The test_x and train_x are subsetted with only the columns in the feature_names that contain
  'mean' or 'std' in the name

- Data from test_x and train_x are combined into combined_x

- Data from the activities (y data) is combined into the `activities` table which is labeled
  with "ActivityID" and "ActivityLabel"

- All the data is combined into the `allData` table

- The data is melted so each row has a unique id and variable combination and is then cast
  into the final shape using dcast, taking the mean of the values. This is stored in
  the `result` variable

- The data in the final result table is written to "clean_dataset.txt" in the current working 
  directory.
